            <p class="underline"> Second year Live project: Grade 66% </p>
            <p> 2nd year live project was to produce a feasibility study providing and comparing options in regard to digitising,
             storing and displaying a large archive for the Greater Manchester Transport Museum. Suggestions made:
             Photocopying and photographs
             website development tools that required minimum web development experience
             archive databases
             web hosting
             In the final report the proposal made for the client was to use a well-established archive database called archives+.
             Another proposal was to use the web-hosting site WordPress because our client is non-profit organisation the wanted to cut costs.
             WordPress allowed the archives to be on the internet and needs minimum web experience. Web-hosting section was researched and implemented by me.
             <p>
            <p class="underline">Final Year Project: Grade 60%</p>
            <p>  My project was about Responsive web design with a database.
            The project has taught me to work independently and has strengthened my research abilities from published literature to well- known sources.
            My analysis of current technology has improved being able to think outside the box and write my one views on a topic.
            Used a variety of programming languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP) and frameworks (bootstrap) to build a fully functioning website.
             Overall the project has helped me to work on a deadline, research and analyse information, independent work and problem solving.
